            This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph
            The paragraph tag belong to the "block" group of tags
            A "block" group tag places your content on a new line

            You can place all your paragraph text context on one physical
            line, however that would require a lot of scrolling right and left.
            You can have word wrap active in your editor and it will NOT affect
            how the browser displays your paragraph content. You can place your
            context on seperate lines yourself and it will NOT affect how the browser displays your paragrph content
        -->
         <p> The paragrph tag is a block atg. A block tag begins a new line when the content is displpayed by your browser.
            The browser does NOT display your content in the physical style of how you have entered your code in html files
        </p>
