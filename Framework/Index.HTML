            The opening tag indicates the end of your element
                and the closing tag indicates the end of your element
            The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag PLUS
                a slash (/) preceeding the name

            The head area of your web page is NOT considered context

            This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph
            The paragraph tag belong to the "block" group of tags
            A "block" group tag places your content on a new line

            You can place all your paragraph text context on one physical
            line, however that would require a lot of scrolling right and left.
            You can have word wrap active in your editor and it will NOT affect
            how the browser displays your paragraph content. You can place your
            context on seperate lines yourself and it will NOT affect how the browser displays your paragrph content
        -->
         <p> The paragrph tag is a block atg. A block tag begins a new line when the content is displpayed by your browser.

                you will be in trouble using the tag
